# lingua-lift
A web application where users can create decks of flashcards to learn a new language. The app's core feature will be a "study mode" that uses a spaced repetition algorithm to show cards at optimal intervals, enhancing memory retention.

Usage Flow:
1. User clicks "Study" on a deck from the Dashboard
2. System loads cards due for review (or new cards if none due)
3. User studies cards, providing feedback on each
4. SRS algorithm calculates next review dates
5. Session completes with performance summary
6. Cards reappear at optimal intervals for maximum retention
